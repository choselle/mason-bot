# Mason Discord Bot #

An application I wrote for fun to annoy my friend Mason when he joins our discord server.  This can be used as a basic template to start a discord bot with simple functionality.  

1. When Mason joins the server, mason bot joins his channel and plays the "Mason Song".
2. If he changes channels, the bot follows with him.
3. Bot disconnects once he leaves the server and can be repeated once he logs back in.
